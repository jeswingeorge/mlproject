# Tutorial

## Adding exceptions/errors to logs folder
Need to import the logger file we created in the `exceptions.py` script.

```
from logger import logging
```

And call it in the main function like this:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        a=1/0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
    except Exception as e:
        logging.info("ZeroDivisionError occurred")  
        raise CustomException(e, sys)
```

Now as we dont need the main function as we wont be calling them directly for checks, we can comment this out from both 
`exceptions.py` and `logger.py` scripts.
