# Tutorial 8 - Create Prediction Pipeline Using Flask Web APP

Now we need to implement the __prediction pipeline__.   
It is important because now we will be creating a web-application which will be interacting with these kind of pickle file we created - __model.pkl__ and __preprocessor.pkl__. These pickle files will interact with the data we give. In the web-application, we will have a form which will interact with the data given by user and once its submitted that data will interact with the __preprocessor.pkl__ and prediction will be done by __model.pkl__. 


I will be using __Streamlit__ instead of Flask.    

I have kept this tuttorial on hold for now, as the main objective of getting End-to-end ML's structure is obtained. 
Once i am in a better position with ML learnings and have enough practice with ML models and pratice I will get back to go ahead with the deployment step.

FOr learning streamlit - [I will use this Streamlit youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuU3eVwK0I9PT48ZBYAHdKPFazhXg76h5).
