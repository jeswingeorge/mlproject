# T2

Right now, folders and files are being created manually, later we can automate it.

In __src__, we will create a folder known as __components__ and add a file named `__init__.py` because component will be created as a package and it can also be imported or exported to other file location.

These components are all the modules we are going to create. Eg: Data ingestion step. Data ingestion is a part of a module when we are developing a module. So in components we will create a file named as `data_ingestion.py`.

After ingestion, next step will be data tansformation and will have steps like - changing categorical to numerical features, one hot encoding, changing column types, etc. So will create a file named as `data_transformation.py`.

Next step, we will be training the model on the transformed data so create a file called `model_trainer.py`. All the models we can use and the accuracy and RMSE checks.

So these 3 files created above are mainly for training purpose.

Next step, we will create a folder named as __pipeline__ in src. We will have 2 types of pipelines - training pipeline - `train_pipeline.py` and prediction pipeline - `predict_pipeline.py`. And we will create a `__init__.py` file so that we can also import it.

Now we will create 3 important file in the __src__ folder - `logger.py` (for logging), `exception.py` (for exceptions) and `utils.py` (for any functionality which we are writing in a common way and will be used in entire application - say read a dataset from a database we can set up the MongoDB client here, if we want to save model to cloud we can write code here.). And we will be calling the `utils.py` inside the components itself. 

[Exceptions Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

## __exception.py__

We will be creating our own custom exception.

import sys library. 

The `sys module` in Python provides access to system-specific parameters and functions, allowing interaction and manipulations with the Python runtime environment. It is part of the Python Standard Library and is always available, though it needs to be imported explicitly.

So if any exceptions come up, the __sys__ library will have that information. 

Creating a function `error_message_detail()` so whenever an exception gets raised, this custom exception message will be created.
This function will have 2 parameters: __error__ (the error message) and __error_detail__ will be present inside the `sys` library.

```
def error_message_details(error, error_detail:sys):
    _,_,exc_tb = error_detail.exc_info()
```

`error_detail.exc_info()` - This will give you 3 informations, we are not interested in the 1st two. But the 3rd info will give `exc_tb`.  
`exc_tb` variable will give details such as on which file the exception has occurred, line number, etc. 

Now thr final code to get the error/exception details:

```
import sys

def error_message_details(error, error_detail:sys):
    _,_,exc_tb = error_detail.exc_info()
    # Extracting the file name and line number where the error occurred
    filename = exc_tb.tb_frame.f_code.co_filename
    line_number = exc_tb.tb_lineno
    error_message = "Error occurred in script: [{0}] at line number: [{1}] with error message: [{2}]".format(
        filename, line_number, str(error)
    )
    # Returning the formatted error message
    return error_message

```
### Explanation of each part

- `sys.exc_info()` returns a tuple: `(type, value, traceback)`
- We're interested only in the traceback object (`exc_tb`) to find where the error occurred.
- Docs: [sys.exc_info()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exc_info)
```
filename = exc_tb.tb_frame.f_code.co_filename
```
- Extracts the file name where the exception occurred.
- This dives into the traceback object to access:
    - `tb_frame`: the current stack frame
    - `f_code`: the code object
    - `co_filename`: the filename of the source code

```
line_number = exc_tb.tb_lineno
```
- Gets the line number in the source code where the exception occurred.


Now what we need to do is that whenever an error has occurred, I need to call this particular function. We can create another class known as `CustomException`.
As we are inheriting from `exception` we need to write `super().__init__(error_message)`.

So whenever `CustomException` is called, it will inherit the parent Exception. And from the function defined it will get the error_message.

### __logger.py__

Logging is for purpose that any execution which happens you should be able to log all these information, exceution in files so that we will be able to track in a text file.

```
logs_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "logs", LOG_FILE) 
```

Every filename will start with _logs_ and with filename coming from LOG_FILE.

```
os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(logs_path), exist_ok=True)
```
This say even though there is a file and folder keep on adding files in this folder.

```
## create path for log file
LOG_FILE_PATH = os.path.join(logs_path, LOG_FILE)
```

Purpose: Creates the full path for the log file by combining a directory path (`logs_path`) and a filename (`LOG_FILE`).

`os.path.join(...)`: Joins path components in a way that's compatible with the operating system (e.g., using `/` on Linux/macOS and `\` on Windows).

```
## create logger using basicConfig
logging.basicConfig(
    filename=LOG_FILE_PATH,
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s - %(lineno)d - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
    datefmt="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
)
````

This function sets up the basic configuration for logging. Here's what each parameter does:
- `filename=LOG_FILE_PATH`

    Logs will be written to the file specified by `LOG_FILE_PATH`.

- `level=logging.INFO`

    Only logs with a severity level of `INFO` or higher (e.g., `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`) will be recorded.

    Lower-severity messages like `DEBUG` will be ignored.

We have kept the folder structure as simple as possible. We will be adding model_evaluation, data_validation, etc,

We can call this script as below by using this function and verify if our script is working correctly or not.
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.info("Logger initialized successfully.")
```

You can see in the root folder a new folder with log files have been created.

We can hence check the scripts `exceptions.py` and `logger.py`.

Linking the scripts `exceptions.py` and `logger.py` will be done in the upcoming scripts.
